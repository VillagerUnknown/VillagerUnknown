# About VillagerUnknown

I'm currently in the process of updating all of my Minecraft 1.21.1 mods and re-releasing them for the later versions. This is to improve performance, include new features, and improve my internal production pipelines.

Villager Coin will be the last mod I release in Minecraft 1.21.1. After which, I will release my mods for _Minecraft 1.21.5/6_, **make improvements based on your feedback**, and update to the latest Minecraft versions when the mod is ready.

- My mods are hosted on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/members/villagerunknown/projects) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/VillagerUnknown).
- My mods can be included in modpacks.
- I am in the process of changing the licensing of my mods to the MIT license.
- I create mods for the Fabric launcher. It's unlikely that I will personally port any of my mods to other launchers.

## Current Project

I am currently working on **Villager Coin**, a coin currency library with various addons. It also optionally changes villager trading to use coins instead of emeralds. 
Your support downloading the mod and providing feedback by creating a Github issue is greatly appreciated!

## Support

Please create a Github issue in the appropriate repository for any feedback or support. 

Updates to my mods will only be considered for the latest version of Minecraft that the mod supports unless a critical issue is reported for a previous version or the community requests changes.
