# About VillagerUnknown

I currently develop Minecraft mods for 1.21.1, make improvements based on your feedback, and update to later Minecraft versions when the mod is ready.

My mods are hosted on CurseForge and Modrinth. Any other platform has hosted my mod without my permission.

Please create a Github issue in the appropriate repository for any feedback or support. Mods will only receive updates for the latest version of Minecraft that the mod supports unless a critical issue is reported for a previous version.



## Current Project

I am currently working on Villager Coin, a currency system with various addons that changes villager trading. Your support downloading the mod and providing feedback by creating a Github issue is greatly appreciated!

## MMORPG Inspired Mods

Inspired by MMORPG's, I have been developing mods that bring features and experiences from World of Warcraft, and other MMORPG's, into Minecraft with the goal of making an Adventure/RPG modpack.

- Graveyards & Ghosts adds World of Warcraft's graveyards and ghosts respawn system to Minecraft's world generation.
- Inns & Innkeepers adds World of Warcraft's innkeeper and hearthstone system to Minecraft.

Your support downloading these mods on CurseForge, and Modrinth, and providing feedback by creating a Github issue is greatly appreciated!
