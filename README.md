# About VillagerUnknown

I currently develop mods for _Minecraft 1.21.1_, make improvements based on your feedback, and update to the latest Minecraft versions when the mod is ready.

- My mods are hosted on CurseForge and Modrinth. Any other platform has hosted my mod(s) without my permission.
- All of my mods are licensed under the [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.en) license and can be distributed freely in modpacks.

Please create a Github issue in the appropriate repository for any feedback or support. 
Mods will only receive updates for the latest version of Minecraft that the mod supports unless a critical issue is reported for a previous version or the community requests changes.



## Current Project

I am currently working on **Villager Coin**, a coin currency library with various addons. It also optionally changes villager trading to use coins instead of emeralds. 
Your support downloading the mod and providing feedback by creating a Github issue is greatly appreciated!
